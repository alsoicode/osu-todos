A responsive, Firebase-connected Todo list built using Angular that demonstrates some of the basic concepts involved in building a small, but non-trivial application.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0 and leverages:

 - [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
 - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
 - [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/)

## Requirements

[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) 6 or Higher

## Getting Started

Modern JavaScript-based applications that leverage Node for compiling/transpiling are usually comprised of one or more "modules", and these modules are typically available via the Node Package Manager (npm) which is installed with Node. All of the following commands should be executed using Terminal on OS X / Linux or PowerShell/Command Prompt on Windows:

- After you download and install Node, ensure it's available on your path by typing: `node -v`

If this command is successful it will return the version of Node that is currently installed. Next, you'll need to:

- Install TypeScript and Typings globally using npm: `npm i typescript@next typings -g`
- Install the project's dependencies: `npm install`

Once the project's dependencies are installed, you will see `node_modules` directory in your project. This directory should NOT be included in source control; it should be unique per developer.

## Running the Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Building the Code for deployment

Run `ng build` (on your command line) to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. To deploy, simply move all of the files in the `dist/` directory to the appropriate directory on your server. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build. Add the `--aot` flag for Ahead Of Time compilation (recommended), example: `ng build --prod --aot`

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
